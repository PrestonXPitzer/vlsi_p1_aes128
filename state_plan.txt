by default IDLE
once start_write_n, PTEXT_WRITE for 4 cycles and then KEY_WRITE for 4 cycles, then COMPUTE_ROUNDKEYS
once key_expand_done, 9 rounds of...
SUBBYTES, SHIFTROWS, MIXCOLUMNS, ADDROUNDKEY
then 1 round of 
SUBBYTES, SHIFTROWS, ADDROUNDKEY
then go to ENCRYPTION_DONE,
wait for start_read_n, then 4 rounds of CTEXT_READ then return to IDLE

in IDLE:
    everything off
in PTEXT_WRITE:
    load column (count_4) with the input data_word (input sel 0)
in KEY_WRITE: 
    load chunk (count_4) with the input data_word
in COMPUTE_ROUNDKEYS:
    simply await the done signal key_expand_done (must be computed a priori)
in SUBBYTES:
    write column (count_4) with the subbytes input (sel 1) 
in SHIFTROWS:
    write row (count_4) with the shiftrows input (sel 2)
in MIXCOLUMNS:
    write column (count_4) with the mixcolumns input (sel 3)
in ADDROUNDKEY:
    write column (count_4) with the ARK input (sel 4)
in ENCRYPTION_DONE
    everything off
in CTEXT_READ:
    show column (count_4) to the output
